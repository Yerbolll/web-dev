    <h1>Popular</h1>
    </body>
    <p>Beggin' on her knees to be popular<br>
That's her dream, to be popular (huh)<br>
Kill anyone to be popular<br>
Sell her soul to be popular (popular)<br>
Just to be popular (uh-huh)<br>
Everybody scream 'cause she popular (huh)<br>
She mainstream 'cause she popular<br>
Never be free 'cause she popular</p>
